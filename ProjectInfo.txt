2012 Jeff Thomas

This project was a solo adventure into the world of OpenGL.  It did not achieve the greatness that I had wanted due to tons of difficulties throwing up multiple textured objects, though it more than fulfilled the class requirement.

I had wanted to add a skybox and a implement a Godzilla-themed interrupt should you leave the map's boundaries, but alas it was not meant to be.  

As OpenGl doesn't support audio inclusion and is simply a display library the inclusion of plane engine sounds or explosion events were not mandatory and I felt the project did not suffer for lack of audio.  

The makefile creates two distinct maps.  The "main" executable map is generated by reading in a raw height map of signed intergers, while the "heightMapTest" is generated by a reading a tga file.
